## üé¨ Video Structure

### Section 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30) - 30 seconds

**What to Show:**
- Landing page of the application

**What to Say:**
```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is the AI Career Agent Platform - 
an intelligent career guidance system powered by AWS Bedrock.

The problem: Job seekers spend countless hours searching for suitable 
positions and optimizing their applications, often without knowing 
which opportunities truly match their skills and experience.

Our solution: An AI agent that autonomously analyzes jobs, scores 
compatibility, optimizes resumes, and provides personalized career 
guidance - all powered by AWS Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Haiku model."
```

**What to Show:**
1. Quick onboarding flow
2. User inputs skills and preferences

**What to Say:**
```
"Let me show you how it works. First, our AI agent gathers your 
professional information through a quick onboarding process.

Notice how the agent asks intelligent questions based on your 
previous answers - this is Claude analyzing your responses in 
real-time to personalize the experience."
```

**Demo Actions:**

#### Part B: AI-Powered Job Matching (0:50 - 1:20)

**What to Show:**
1. Job search dashboard
2. AI compatibility scores (0-100)
3. Detailed job analysis

**What to Say:**
```
"Now watch the AI agent in action. It autonomously:

1. Fetches jobs from multiple sources - LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor
2. Analyzes each job description using AWS Bedrock
3. Calculates a 0-100 compatibility score by comparing your profile 
   against job requirements

See this score of 85? The AI agent determined this by analyzing 
skills match, experience level, location preferences, and salary 
expectations. It's making complex decisions autonomously - no 
hardcoded rules, just intelligent reasoning from Claude 3.5 Haiku."
```

**Demo Actions:**
- Show job list with scores
- Click on a high-scoring job
- Show detailed compatibility breakdown

"The agent also optimizes your resume. Watch as it:

1. Analyzes your resume for ATS compatibility
2. Identifies strengths and weaknesses
3. Provides specific, actionable suggestions

And here's the powerful part - you can tailor your resume for any 
specific job. The AI agent reads the job description, understands 
the requirements, and tells you exactly what to add or emphasize.

This is true AI autonomy - understanding context, making decisions, 
and providing intelligent recommendations."

- Lambda functions handle serverless compute
- DynamoDB stores user and job data
- S3 manages resume storage
- Cognito handles authentication
- API Gateway orchestrates everything

The agent demonstrates true autonomy: it uses reasoning LLMs for
