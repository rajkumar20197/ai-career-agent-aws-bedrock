## Official Compliance Declaration

This document certifies that the **AI Career Agent Platform** fully complies with all requirements of the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon Official Rules.

---

## 🎯 Project Qualification

### ✅ AI Agent Requirements (All 3 Conditions Met)

#### 1. Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on AWS ✅
- **Service Used:** AWS Bedrock
- **Model:** Claude 3.5 Haiku (`anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`)
- **Implementation:** See `backend/lambda/bedrock_integration.py`
- **Evidence:** Bedrock Runtime client initialized and used throughout application

```python
bedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')
MODEL_ID = "anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0"
```

#### 2. Uses Required AWS Services ✅

**Primary Service - Amazon Bedrock:** ✅
- Resume analysis via Bedrock
- Job compatibility scoring via Bedrock
- Career roadmap generation via Bedrock
- Market insights analysis via Bedrock
- Interview question generation via Bedrock
- Email analysis via Bedrock

**Supporting AWS Services:**
- ✅ AWS Lambda (Python 3.11 runtime) - Serverless compute
- ✅ Amazon DynamoDB - User, Jobs, Applications tables
- ✅ Amazon S3 - Resume storage
- ✅ Amazon Cognito - User authentication
- ✅ Amazon API Gateway - REST API endpoints
- ✅ Amazon CloudWatch - Logging and monitoring

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ AWS CloudFormation - Infrastructure as Code
- ✅ IAM Roles - Security and permissions

#### 3. AWS-Defined AI Agent Qualification ✅

##### a) Uses Reasoning LLMs for Decision-Making ✅

**Evidence:**
- **Job Matching:** AI analyzes job descriptions and user profiles to calculate 0-100 compatibility scores
  ```python
  def calculate_job_score(user_id: str, job_id: str) -> int:
      # Uses Claude to reason about job fit based on multiple factors
  ```

- **Resume Analysis:** AI reasons about resume quality, ATS compatibility, and improvement areas
  ```python
  def analyze_resume(resume_text: str) -> Dict:
      # Claude analyzes and scores resume on multiple dimensions
  ```

- **Career Planning:** AI generates personalized roadmaps by reasoning about career progression
  ```python
  def generate_career_roadmap(current_role, target_role, skills) -> Dict:
      # Claude reasons about skill gaps and creates learning paths
  ```

- **Market Intelligence:** AI synthesizes market data to provide insights and predictions
  ```python
  def get_market_insights(role: str, location: str) -> Dict:
      # Claude analyzes market trends and makes predictions
  ```

##### b) Demonstrates Autonomous Capabilities ✅

**Evidence:**
- **Automatic Job Scoring:** Agent automatically evaluates all jobs without human intervention
- **Self-Initiated Analysis:** Agent proactively analyzes resumes upon upload
- **Autonomous Recommendations:** Agent generates suggestions without prompting
- **Continuous Operation:** Agent monitors and processes data independently
- **Email Detection:** Agent automatically detects interview invitations from emails

**With Human Input:**
- User provides initial profile data
- User uploads resume
- User requests specific analysis

**Without Human Input:**
- Agent scores jobs automatically
- Agent generates insights proactively
- Agent optimizes recommendations continuously
- Agent monitors application status

##### c) Integrates APIs, Databases, External Tools ✅

**APIs Integrated:**
- ✅ AWS Bedrock API (AI/ML)
- ✅ LinkedIn API (Job data) - Mock implementation ready for real integration
- ✅ Indeed API (Job data) - Mock implementation ready for real integration
- ✅ Glassdoor API (Job data) - Mock implementation ready for real integration
- ✅ Gmail API (Email analysis) - Mock implementation ready for real integration

**Databases:**
- ✅ DynamoDB Users Table - User profiles and preferences
- ✅ DynamoDB Jobs Table - Job listings and metadata
- ✅ DynamoDB Applications Table - Application tracking

**External Tools:**
- ✅ S3 Storage - Resume file management
- ✅ Cognito Authentication - User identity management
- ✅ CloudWatch Logging - System monitoring

**Multi-Agent Orchestration:**
- Agent coordinates between resume analysis, job matching, and market intelligence
- Agent integrates data from multiple sources for holistic recommendations
- Agent manages workflows across different AWS services
